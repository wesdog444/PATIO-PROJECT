Overview:
Surface Area and Volume Summative Patio Project

	Mrs. Kazlauskas would like to share a fictitious conversation of installing a pretend patio with you. There is a lot of math involved in home projects and the knowledge could potentially help you with projects of your own in the future.  To complete this project, you are required to read the dialogue between Mrs. K and her husband.  

Be on the lookout for important information regarding how much product will be used and how much it will cost while reading the conversation. 

Mrs. K:  Did you get a chance to look at those patio plans I wrote up?

Mr. Kaz:  Yes I did.  I think that looks good.  I like the look of the Holland pavers, what do you think about gray?

Mrs. K:  Love it, I checked Home Depot to see how much they cost and the good news is that the website said they will deliver (which I will do only for the bricks)! I had to ask for help, but the employee said I should need 4.5 pavers per square foot.

Mr. Kaz:  What about gravel and sand? Isn’t that what you said goes underneath the pavers?

Mrs. K:  Underneath the patio there is a 4 inch deep base of gravel.  On top of that is a 1.5 inch level of bedding sand.  Then the pavers rest on top of that.

Mr. K:  Won’t you have to dig out the dirt that’s there now?

Mrs. K:  Yeah, we will have to dig down enough to account for the gravel, bedding sand, and thickness of the pavers.

Mr. Kaz:  How much is the gravel and sand going to cost us?

Mrs. K:  The gravel is  $17.50 a cubic yard and the sand is $20 a cubic yard. They only deliver full cubic yards.   

Mr. Kaz:  Sounds good.  How does the edge of the patio stay in place?

Mrs. K:  We have to get a paver edge to hammer down around the perimeter of the patio. The edging comes in 10 foot sections and sell for $9.95 a piece.  Then we need to drive a spike into the edging every 3 feet and they cost $1.00 each. The good news is we don’t have to put edging or spikes on the sides that connect to the house.

Mr. Kaz:  That sounds pretty cheap.  I’m concerned though about one thing.  How are we going to make this patio level?  Won’t it settle into the ground?

Mrs. K:  You’re absolutely right…it would.  Therefore, we need to rent a 15.5’’x 23” plate compactor from Ralph’s General Rent-all.  We will use this to compact the gravel.  We’ll need to rent it for 1 day for this and then a second day to compact the bricks in place.

Mr. Kaz:  Can’t we just do that in one day to save another day’s rental fee?

Mrs. K:  I like where your head's at, but unfortunately not.  We’ll need to rent it for two days.

Mr. Kaz:  What about the edge of the patio?  How will you cut those bricks?

Mrs. K:  We’ll have to rent a “Wet Tub Stand Saw w/ diamond” for a full day.

Mr. Kaz:  This sounds like it is getting expensive.  Are you sure this is going to be cheaper than the $7,500 we were quoted by that professional?

Mrs. K:  Don’t worry, I promise I’ll have my geometry students calculate and report back to you on how much money we saved by doing this ourselves.

Mr. Kaz:  So is that everything?  I’m nervous about the brick patio.  I don’t want weeds growing up in between the bricks so I have to keep picking them out.

Mrs. K:  I was worried about that too.  We’ll put landscape fabric down first to help with that.  I also  found this new product called paver set-polymeric sand by Sakrete. You spread it between the cracks of the bricks, wet it, and then it hardens like a soft concrete so the weeds don’t penetrate it. 

Mr. Kaz:  That’s awesome!  Is it expensive?

Mrs. K:  Not too bad, I found some at Home Depot.  I have to look at the product information to see how many 40 lb tubs I need. I will look at the product information to decide how much coverage one tub will get us and use the smaller coverage estimate to make sure I have enough.

Mr. Kaz:  Okay.  Is that it?

Mrs. K:  Yeah, I guess I’ll go get my shovel and get started. Just kidding, you have to help!
